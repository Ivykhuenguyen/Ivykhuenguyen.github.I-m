    <h1>HOW TO USE A DISHWASHER</h1>
    <h5>this website exists because the manual is too confusing and makes your brain hurts </h5>
</body>
<html>
<h2> STEPS</h2>
<h4>STEP 1</h4>
<p>Open the dishwasher,pull out the baskets</p>
<h4>STEP 2</h4>
<p> Put the bowls and the cups on top basket. Make sure
    there is enough space between the items so the water can go
    through. Place the items upside down.</p>
<h4>STEP 3</h4>
<p>Close the upper basket, now start putting the plates,
    the pots and their lids, the pans on the bottom basket. </p>

<h3>The dishwasher cannot wash all the food pieces off the plates/bowls, so you should rinse
    off all the food pieces before you put it in the dishwasher!
</h3>
<h4>STEP 4</h4>
<p>But what about the cutlery? There is a small basket that is placed inside the bottom basket
    (where you put the plates previously), and you can
    put the cutlery in there.</p>
<h4>STEP 5</h4>
<p>when you have finished putting all the things in, close the dishwaher, and put the soap cube/dishwasher 
    detergent (there is a different place to put it in for each type) . Now adjust the washing 
    preference (how much time, how much soap, temperature). Click start</p>
<h3> CONGRATS, YOU HAVE DONE IT</h3>
<p>Now, another part of using the dishwasher is how to logically organize all the things so that it
    fit in the dishwasher. I cannot teach you that, but overtime, you gain more experience
    and can use the dishwasher like a professional! Now your parents have one less thing to be 
    disappointed about!</p>
