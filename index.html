<h2>Why is this skill important?</h2>
<p>Doing the dishes by hand is exhausting and time consuming, but that problem is solved by the dishwasher!
With the dishwasher, you can save a lot of time, and it is proven to be more efficient according to users
 as well! That requires some skill and knowledge though, because the dishwasher can be quite complicated,
  lucky for you, this website is going to teach you how!</p>
<h2>REQUIRED ITEMS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A dishwasher</li>
    <li>Soap/detergent</li>
    <li>Dishes to wash</li>
</ul>
<h2> STEPS</h2>
<h4>STEP 1</h4>
<p>Open the dishwasher,pull out the racks</p>
<h4>STEP 2</h4>
<p> Put the bowls and the cups on top rack. Make sure
    there is enough space between the items so the water can go
    through. Place the items upside down.</p>

<h4>STEP 3</h4>
<p>Close the upper rack, now start putting the plates,
    the pots and their lids, the pans on the bottom rack.</p>

<h3>The dishwasher cannot wash all the food pieces off the plates/bowls, so you should rinse
    off all the food pieces before you put it in the dishwasher!
</h3>
<h4>STEP 4</h4>
<p>But what about the cutlery? There is a small basket that is placed inside the bottom basket
    (where you put the plates previously), and you can
    put the cutlery in there.</p>

<h4>STEP 5</h4>
<p>when you have finished putting all the things in, close the dishwaher, and put the soap pod/dishwasher 
    detergent (there is a door for each type). Now adjust the washing 
    preference (how much time, how much soap, temperature). Click start</p>

<h3> CONGRATS, YOU HAVE DONE IT</h3>
<p> If your dishes are clean after you use the dishwasher, and if you have an easier time doing the dishes by
    using it, you have excelled this skill! However, another part of using the dishwasher is how to 
    logically organize all the things so that it all fit in the dishwasher. This website cannot teach you that,
    but overtime, you gain more experience and can use the dishwasher like a professional!</p>
