How to be More Confident Presenting

</body>

<h1>    Confidence is key to giving a successful presentation. Here are some tips to help you be more confident:</h1>
<p>
    Know your material - The more familiar you are with your topic, the more confident 
    you'll feel when presenting it. The best way to do this is experiencing your own topic, this for sure 
    will give you a tighter grip. I know this because I have excelled many presentations in various topics
    by speaking on my own experiences. For instance, I talked about experiences in food, culture, evasion of taxes,
    and how to use different tools. 
    
    Practice, practice, practice - Rehearsing your presentation beforehand can help you feel more
    prepared and confident. Talk to yourself in front of the mirror before you present. 
    
    Focus on your breathing - stop breathing. when you see death rushing in, it will give you the right motivation, 
    since you do not have much time. A lot of motivation can quickly turn into confidence.
</p>
<p>    
    Dress the part - Wearing clothes that make you feel confident and professional can help you feel
    more self-assured during your presentation. Such as victorian dresses that victorian women used
    to wear attending balls, because those women have full confidence walking into the ball room
    because they know they look gorgeous. Hair matters as well, make sure you get the Ye haircut, since Kanye
    is so confident, he says whatever he wants to say without thinking about consequences and logic (pls 
    consider logic thou).

<p>
    Make eye contact - Looking at your audience in the eye can help you feel more 
    connected and confident. Stare intensely at your teacher and classmates, make sure to wink a few times and
    bite your lips. The more uncomfortable you make them, theyll look away, and now you can feel more confident,
    knowing that no one is looking at you. 
    
    Use body language - growl. crawl. be an absolute alpha furry.
</p>
    
    Dont be afraid to pause - Taking a moment to collect your thoughts and pause during 
    your presentation can help you feel more in control and confident. Being quiet for a moment can also gain 
    your audiences attention, just in case you didnt.    
    
    Remember, confidence takes practice and time to develop. By implementing these
    tips, you can gradually improve your presentation skills and feel more confident in front of an audience
